## Overview

This project was built as a collaboration between students in the Front-End Engineering and Ruby on Rails courses at The Iron Yard in Durham.

In short, this app is a survey building app. Users can create accounts and create surveys to share with their friends. Anyone can take a survey, and can take the survey as many times as they wish!
